Iterate through 10,000 X-rays
Iterate through each row of pixels in the X-ray
Working from the outside in on both sides, mark all black pixels (set value of pixel to 999)
When all 10,000 X-rays have been processed, compute the average pixel value at every pixel location
When the average for a pixel location is 999, it means all the X-rays are black at that location
Store that location in a list of lists (list_to_delete)

Inject a process to delete all the pixel locations where the average was 999, for all 377,110 X-rays
This process should occur before other processing such as scaling are performed

Develop an algorithm that performs convolutions on irregularly shaped images. For 3x3 convolutions,
I would need to have 3 pixels to the right, and 3 down for each convolution. If it doesn't exist, skip
to the next pixel across the columns and the rows.

Create a vector of pixels by joining each row to the prior row.

For fun, calculate the percentage of pixels eliminated

Think about how to eliminate the cervical spine down to C6 or C7.
